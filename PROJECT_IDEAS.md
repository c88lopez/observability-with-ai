# Monitoring and Observability Project Ideas

## Project Overview
**Date Started:** July 26, 2025  
**Focus:** Grafana Dashboards and Monitoring Services

## Initial Concept
Build a comprehensive monitoring and observability platform using the Grafana and Prometheus stack to monitor diverse systems and applications across different environments.

### Core Components
- **Grafana**: Primary dashboard and visualization tool for creating interactive dashboards
- **Prometheus**: Time-series database and monitoring system for metrics collection
- **Exporters**: Various Prometheus exporters for different system types
- **Alertmanager**: Handle alerts sent by Prometheus server

## Project Goals
Create a unified monitoring solution that provides comprehensive visibility into system health, performance metrics, and application behavior across heterogeneous environments.

### Primary Objectives
- [ ] Set up Grafana and Prometheus monitoring stack
- [ ] Monitor machine resources (CPU, memory, disk, network) across Windows/macOS/Linux
- [ ] Monitor Kubernetes cluster metrics (nodes, pods, deployments, services, resource utilization)
- [ ] Monitor database systems (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB performance and health)
- [ ] Monitor Redis instances (memory usage, connections, operations, replication)
- [ ] Monitor message queues (RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka, queue depths, throughput)
- [ ] Create infrastructure-focused dashboards for operations teams
- [ ] Implement alerting for resource exhaustion and service failures

### Secondary Objectives
- [ ] Add custom business metrics for application performance
- [ ] Implement distributed tracing for microservices
- [ ] Create automated deployment and configuration management
- [ ] Build custom exporters for proprietary applications
- [ ] Develop capacity planning and trend analysis dashboards
- [ ] Integrate with incident management and notification systems 

## Technical Requirements
Technology stack and infrastructure components needed for the monitoring platform.

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Docker containers for easy deployment and scalability
- [ ] Persistent storage for Prometheus time-series data
- [ ] Load balancer for high availability (if needed)
- [ ] SSL/TLS certificates for secure communications
- [ ] Network connectivity between monitoring targets and collectors

### Data Sources
- [ ] **Machine Resources**: Node Exporter (Linux/macOS), Windows Exporter (Windows)
- [ ] **Kubernetes**: kube-state-metrics, kubelet/cAdvisor, Prometheus Operator
- [ ] **Databases**: 
  - MySQL Exporter (connections, queries, InnoDB metrics)
  - PostgreSQL Exporter (connections, queries, replication lag)
  - MongoDB Exporter (operations, connections, replica set status)
- [ ] **Redis**: Redis Exporter (memory, keys, operations, replication)
- [ ] **Message Queues**:
  - RabbitMQ Exporter (queue depths, message rates, consumer lag)
  - Kafka Exporter (topic metrics, consumer lag, broker health)
- [ ] **Infrastructure**: SNMP exporters for network devices, load balancers

### Monitoring Targets
- [ ] **Machine Resources**: CPU utilization, memory usage, disk I/O, network traffic, filesystem usage
- [ ] **Kubernetes Metrics**: 
  - Cluster: Node status, resource quotas, persistent volumes
  - Workloads: Pod status, deployment health, replica counts, resource requests/limits
  - Networking: Service discovery, ingress traffic, network policies
- [ ] **Database Performance**:
  - MySQL: Query performance, connection pool, replication lag, table locks
  - PostgreSQL: Connection counts, query duration, vacuum operations, replication
  - MongoDB: Collection stats, index usage, replica set health, sharding metrics
- [ ] **Redis Monitoring**: Memory usage, hit/miss ratios, connected clients, replication delay
- [ ] **Message Queue Health**:
  - RabbitMQ: Queue depths, message publish/consume rates, exchange performance
  - Kafka: Topic throughput, consumer lag, partition distribution, broker availability
- [ ] **Infrastructure Health**: Network latency, SSL certificate expiration, service availability 

## Implementation Phases
<!-- Break down the project into manageable phases -->

### Phase 1: Planning & Setup
- [ ] Finalize project requirements
- [ ] Set up development environment
- [ ] Choose technology stack

### Phase 2: Core Implementation
- [ ] Deploy Prometheus server with proper retention and storage configuration
- [ ] Set up Grafana with Prometheus data source and basic authentication
- [ ] Install Node/Windows exporters on target machines
- [ ] Configure Kubernetes monitoring (kube-state-metrics, kubelet scraping)
- [ ] Deploy database exporters (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- [ ] Set up Redis and message queue monitoring
- [ ] Create fundamental dashboards for each service type
- [ ] Implement basic alerting rules for critical thresholds

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Create custom dashboards for specific use cases
- [ ] Implement advanced alerting with Alertmanager
- [ ] Add service discovery for dynamic environments
- [ ] Integrate with external systems (Slack, PagerDuty, etc.)
- [ ] Implement backup and disaster recovery procedures
- [ ] Performance tuning and optimization 

## Notes & Ideas
<!-- Use this section for brainstorming and random thoughts -->

### Architecture Considerations
- Consider using Docker Compose for local development and testing
- Plan for horizontal scaling of Prometheus (federation or Thanos)
- Think about data retention policies and storage requirements
- Consider multi-tenancy if monitoring multiple organizations/projects

### Dashboard Ideas
- **Infrastructure Overview**: Multi-host resource utilization and health status
- **Kubernetes Cluster Dashboard**: Nodes, pods, deployments, resource usage
- **Database Performance Dashboard**: Query performance, connections, replication status
- **Redis Monitoring Dashboard**: Memory usage, operations, replication health
- **Message Queue Dashboard**: Queue depths, throughput, consumer lag
- **Capacity Planning Dashboard**: Resource trends and growth projections
- **SRE Summary Dashboard**: SLI/SLO tracking and error budgets

### Potential Challenges
- Network connectivity and firewall configurations for exporter access
- Database monitoring permissions and security considerations
- Kubernetes RBAC configuration for metrics collection
- Message queue authentication and connection management
- High-cardinality metrics causing Prometheus performance issues
- Alert fatigue from noisy infrastructure notifications
- Data retention and storage scaling for high-frequency metrics
