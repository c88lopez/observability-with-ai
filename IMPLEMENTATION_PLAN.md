# Implementation Plan

## Technical Architecture Overview

### Core Stack
- **Prometheus**: Time-series database and metrics collection
- **Grafana**: Dashboard and visualization platform
- **Alertmanager**: Alert routing and notification management
- **Docker Compose**: Local development and testing environment

### Deployment Strategy
- Start with Docker Compose for rapid development and testing
- Design for easy migration to Kubernetes/production later
- Use configuration files that can be version controlled
- Implement modular approach for easy component swapping

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Week 1-2)

### 1.1 Development Environment
- [ ] Set up Docker Compose stack (Prometheus + Grafana + Alertmanager)
- [ ] Configure persistent volumes for data retention
- [ ] Set up basic authentication and SSL (self-signed for dev)
- [ ] Create initial Prometheus configuration with basic scrape targets

### 1.2 Basic Machine Monitoring
- [ ] Deploy Node Exporter for Linux/macOS monitoring
- [ ] Set up Windows Exporter for Windows machines (if available)
- [ ] Create basic host overview dashboard
- [ ] Implement fundamental alerts (high CPU, memory, disk space)

### 1.3 Configuration Management
- [ ] Create modular Prometheus configuration files
- [ ] Set up Grafana provisioning for automated dashboard deployment
- [ ] Implement alert rule files with version control
- [ ] Document configuration patterns for future expansion

## Phase 2: Service Monitoring (Week 3-4)

### 2.1 Database Monitoring
- [ ] Deploy MySQL Exporter and create test database
- [ ] Deploy PostgreSQL Exporter and configure monitoring
- [ ] Set up MongoDB Exporter (if available)
- [ ] Create database performance dashboards
- [ ] Implement database-specific alerting rules

### 2.2 Cache and Message Queue Monitoring
- [ ] Deploy Redis Exporter and configure monitoring
- [ ] Set up RabbitMQ Exporter (or Kafka depending on availability)
- [ ] Create cache and queue performance dashboards
- [ ] Implement capacity and performance alerts

### 2.3 Kubernetes Integration (if K8s cluster available)
- [ ] Deploy kube-state-metrics
- [ ] Configure kubelet and cAdvisor scraping
- [ ] Create Kubernetes cluster overview dashboard
- [ ] Implement pod and node alerting rules

## Phase 3: Enhancement and Optimization (Week 5-6)

### 3.1 Dashboard Refinement
- [ ] Create role-based dashboard collections
- [ ] Implement dashboard templating for multi-environment support
- [ ] Add custom panels and visualizations
- [ ] Create mobile-friendly dashboard variants

### 3.2 Advanced Alerting
- [ ] Configure Alertmanager with multiple notification channels
- [ ] Implement alert grouping and routing rules
- [ ] Create runbooks and alert documentation
- [ ] Set up alert testing and validation procedures

### 3.3 Performance and Scaling
- [ ] Optimize Prometheus configuration for performance
- [ ] Implement data retention policies
- [ ] Test with high-cardinality metrics
- [ ] Plan for horizontal scaling (federation or Thanos)

## Flexibility Considerations

### Modular Design Principles
- **Configuration as Code**: All configs in version control
- **Template-Based Dashboards**: Easy to duplicate and modify for new services
- **Layered Alert Rules**: Basic → Service-Specific → Business Logic
- **Plugin Architecture**: Easy to add new exporters and data sources

### Future Extension Points
- **New Service Types**: Framework for adding custom exporters
- **Multiple Environments**: Dev/Staging/Prod configuration templates
- **Custom Metrics**: Application-specific monitoring integration
- **Log Integration**: ELK stack or Loki integration points
- **Tracing Integration**: Jaeger or Zipkin integration hooks

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Complete
- [ ] Monitoring stack running locally via Docker Compose
- [ ] Basic machine metrics collected and visualized
- [ ] Fundamental alerts working and tested
- [ ] Configuration documented and version controlled

### Phase 2 Complete
- [ ] Database and cache monitoring operational
- [ ] Service-specific dashboards created and tested
- [ ] Alert coverage for critical service metrics
- [ ] Documentation updated with monitoring procedures

### Phase 3 Complete
- [ ] Production-ready dashboard suite
- [ ] Comprehensive alerting with proper routing
- [ ] Performance optimized for expected load
- [ ] Migration plan documented for production deployment

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Data Volume**: Start with short retention, expand gradually
- **Network Access**: Use local services first, expand to remote gradually
- **Security**: Implement authentication early, enhance incrementally
- **Performance**: Monitor Prometheus performance, optimize as needed

### Operational Risks
- **Alert Fatigue**: Start with conservative thresholds, refine based on data
- **Dashboard Overload**: Create focused, role-based dashboard collections
- **Configuration Drift**: Use provisioning and version control consistently
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Document everything, create runbooks early

## Timeline Flexibility
- Each phase can be extended based on learning and feedback
- Components can be implemented in parallel where dependencies allow
- New requirements can be added to future phases without disrupting current work
- Success criteria can be adjusted based on actual environment constraints
