# Monitoring and Observability Stack

A comprehensive monitoring solution using Grafana and Prometheus to monitor infrastructure, applications, and services across different environments.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project provides a complete monitoring and observability platform designed to monitor:
- **Machine Resources**: CPU, memory, disk, network across Windows/macOS/Linux
- **Kubernetes Clusters**: Nodes, pods, deployments, services, resource utilization  
- **Databases**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB performance and health metrics
- **Cache Systems**: Redis memory usage, operations, replication status
- **Message Queues**: RabbitMQ, Kafka queue depths, throughput, consumer lag

## 📚 Documentation

- **[Project Ideas](PROJECT_IDEAS.md)** - Detailed project scope, goals, and requirements
- **[Implementation Plan](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)** - 6-week phased development approach
- **[Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Technical architecture and design decisions
- **[Quick Start Guide](QUICK_START.md)** - 15-minute setup guide to get started

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Prerequisites**: Docker, Docker Compose, and basic Prometheus/Grafana knowledge
2. **Setup**: Follow the [Quick Start Guide](QUICK_START.md) for immediate deployment
3. **Development**: Use the modular configuration approach for easy customization

## 🎭 Current Status

**Phase**: Planning and Architecture ✅  
**Next**: Implementation Phase 1 - Foundation Setup

### Completed
- [x] Project scope and requirements definition
- [x] Technical architecture design
- [x] Implementation roadmap creation
- [x] Documentation framework setup
- [x] Git repository initialization

### Coming Next
- [ ] Docker Compose stack creation
- [ ] Basic Prometheus and Grafana setup
- [ ] Host monitoring with Node Exporter
- [ ] Initial dashboard creation

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Prometheus**: Time-series database and metrics collection
- **Grafana**: Dashboard and visualization platform
- **Alertmanager**: Alert routing and notification management
- **Docker Compose**: Development and deployment orchestration
- **Various Exporters**: Service-specific metric collectors

## 🔄 Development Approach

- **Modular Design**: Easy to add/remove/modify components
- **Configuration as Code**: All configurations version controlled
- **Incremental Development**: Start simple, add complexity gradually
- **Documentation First**: Every decision documented for maintainability

## 📈 Implementation Phases

1. **Foundation Setup** (Weeks 1-2): Core monitoring stack deployment
2. **Service Monitoring** (Weeks 3-4): Database, cache, and queue monitoring
3. **Enhancement** (Weeks 5-6): Advanced dashboards, alerting, and optimization
